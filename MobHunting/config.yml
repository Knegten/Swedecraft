# Rewards for killing mobs.
# ########################################################################
# Here is where you set the base prize in $ for killing a mob of each type
# You can either set a decimal number ex 1.23 or a range 1.23:2.23
# For each kill you can run a console command to give the player a reward.
# You can use the following variables:
# {killer},{killed},{player},{killed_player},{prize},{world},
# {killerpos},{killedpos}. Killerpos and Killedpos will have the 
# format <x> <y> <z>. Which could be used to /summon items. 
# An example could be /summon apple {killedpos} 2. to summon two apples where
# where the mob was killed or /summon apple {killerpos} 1. to summon an
# an apple where the player is.
# Another example could be to give the player permission to fly
# for 1 hour or use give command to the player items.
# You can also specify the message send to the player.
# You can run many console commands on each line, each command
# must be separated by |
# The player will have the cmd run in {mob-cmd-run-frequency} out of
# {mob-cmd-run-frequency-base} times in average. If mob-cmd-run-frequency=0 it
# will never run. If f.ex. mob-cmd-run-frequency=50 and 
# mob-cmd-run-frequency-base=100 it will run run every second time.
